            <p>
                Hello there! I'm Sid. This blog is being written just to talk about what I'm planning on doing with this website.
            </p>

            <p>
                For starters, this is a personal website that I'll be using to post about my recent adventures or events. Not
                everything in my blog has to be programming or game development related, so, I might post about my travels or
                something. GOD KNOWS!
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyways! This is where I'm gonna end my first blog. Every uneventful and short. Heck, maybe even the shortest out
                there! (<i>That's what she said</i> &#128557;)
            </p>
